# myLabyrinth

Use javac *.java or javac Laglabyrint.java to compile the program 


Use java Laglabyrint to start the program. A GUI window should open. Use choose file to choose a .in labyrinth file.  


There should be about three different .in text files, which simulates a labyrinth. 

  
The main functionality to the program is to find the shortest path through a labyrinth (cycle and non-cycles) using recursion. 

It also sums all different solutions. 

  
This is a part of a school project, therefor the implementation is in English/Norwegian. However, it should be able to understand the code.
